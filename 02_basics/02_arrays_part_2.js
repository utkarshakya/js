// 1. Array.from() --> Creates a new Array instance from an iterable or array-like object.
// 2. Array.isArray() --> Returns true if the argument is an array, or false otherwise.
// 3. Array.of() --> Creates a new Array instance with a variable number of arguments, regardless of number or type of the arguments.

console.log(Array.of("Amigo", 34, 381, "Galactus", num1, num2));
// See the output to get them all.

// Instance Methods & Properties: Called on instances of the object.
