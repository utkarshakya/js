// --- --- Filter --- ---
const num = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6];
// console.log(num.forEach((e) => {return e+3;}));
// If you try to run thr above line of code you'll get undefined, that means we can not return
// any value from callback function in for each loop. And to cater this problem we use filter.
let result = num.filter(e => e > 3);
console.log(result);
// Although we can get values from forEach callback function using some
// conditional statements, but filter works in simply.
// Like see the below example from that we also get the same result.
let arr = [];
num.forEach(e => {
    if(e > 3){
        arr.push(e);
    }
});
console.log(arr);
// You can use anything both works fine. But when the structure is complex it's better to use filter.
// Below example make it more clear to you.
